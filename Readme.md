# Homework 4 - Group 21

This repository contains the results of the [__Homework 4__](https://github.com/CriMenghini/ADM-2018/tree/master/Homework_4) of Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining. The collaborators of this homework were __Basso Mattias__ and __Falconi Cristina__, unfortunately the third member -  Omid Ghamiloo - did not reply to our messages, and did not send any message to us in the following two weeks.

## Part 1 - Web Scraping / Clustering

All the __data__ used to perform the tasks of the first part of the Hw were taken from [Immobiliare](https://www.immobiliare.it/vendita-case/roma/?criterio=rilevanza&pag=1) site, which contains thousands of announcements regarding houses and apartments for sale - in our case located in __Rome__ .

## Part 2 - Hashing - Removing duplicates

For the second part we were given a _.txt file_ containing millions of rows, composed by _strings of fixed length (20 characters)_ that could contain every kind of character identified by Unicode.

### Side Notes

Due to the fact that the text file given to us (Part 2 of the hw) was hugely heavy (2.2 GB) and too hard to handle for our Mac/PCs, we decided to cut it down to one third of the size, picking one row every three and writing them down to a new file.

Our work is presented in two separate Jupyter Notebooks, one for each part of the assignment.
